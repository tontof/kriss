That's it !

* FAQ (Frequently Ask Question)
** Why did I create KrISS feed ?
   I was using Google Reader and when Google decided to [[http://googlereader.blogspot.fr/2011/10/upcoming-changes-to-reader-new-look-new.html][integrate
   Google+]] it was for me the end (before the [[http://googlereader.blogspot.fr/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html][official one]] on July 1,
   2013): "As a result of these changes, we also think it's important
   to clean things up a bit. Many of Reader's social features will
   soon be available via Google+, so in a week's time we'll be
   retiring things like friending, following and shared link blogs
   inside of Reader."

   I have looked at existing solutions (rssLounge, tiny tiny RSS, ...)
   but I was not happy so I've coded mine (as we say: "if you want
   something done right, do it yourself").
** What is KISS philosophy ?
   The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle][KISS]] principle has many definitions and everyone lets define
   KISS as he wants. For me, KrISS feed should be as accessible as
   possible for everyone. That's why, there is for example, no SQL
   database to configure and a single file to copy for end users. But
   it should also be smart and that's why source code is easy to
   understand and well structured.

   I'm not satisfied yet because there still a lot of work to do, but
   hey, there are just 24 hours per day :-)
** Why I can not add or update my feeds properly (Problem with last update) ?
   First of all check your feed validity:
   http://validator.w3.org/feed/
   
   KrISS feed uses libxml2 and if the feed is not well formated, it
   will fail. Contact the feed owner to tell him to correct his feed.

   If the feed is correct, there could be server configuration
   problems. For now KrISS feed errors are not very explicit, open an
   issue on [[https://github.com/tontof/kriss_feed/issues][github]] if you want more help.
** Does it work on free.fr ?
   No, external accesses are disabled since December 1, 2008.
